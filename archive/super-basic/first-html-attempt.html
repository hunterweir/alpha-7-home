<h1>Design For The Web Docs Project</h1>

<p>This project is designed to test our skills in Google Docs (actual) vs our perceived skills. Hopefully leading us as students to understand that these programs and tools we rely on, and seem so intuitive and easy to use are actually carefully designed and perhaps we’re even underutilizing them. </p>

<h2>My Favorite Place: Clear Creek in Denton, TX</h2>

<p>Clear Creek is a nature preserve on the outskirts of Denton, TX. I love it because it feels like a forest and a way to reconnect with nature. I like to watch the different seasons change within the ecosystem there, and the trees are lovely. It’s like my little sanctuary. </p>

<p>My Favorite Things about Clear Creek</p>
<ul>

	<li>Escape from civilization
	<li>Soft dirt paths

<h2>Foods: an overview</h2>

<p>Foods in general fall into three categories: fruits, vegetables, meats, cereals. The macro nutrients they contain are fat, protein and carbohydrates. We need food as fuel to survive. Every living organism is food for another organism, the circle of life!</p>

<h3>FRUITS</h3>

<p>Examples:</p> 
<ol>
<li>-Strawberries
<li>-Grapes 
<li>-Cranberries
</ol>

<h3>VEGGIES</h3>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>-Carrots
<li>-Celery
<li>-Onions
</ol>
<p>Food is complex!</p>

<p>Hopefully these examples give an idea of how amazing food can be, and difficult to understand! So much more to go into, this is just scratching the surface really. Bon appetite!</p>
